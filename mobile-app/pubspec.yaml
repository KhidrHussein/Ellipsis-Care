# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/authentication/
    - assets/icons/home/nav_bar/
    - assets/icons/home/actions/
    - assets/icons/dashboard/
    - assets/icons/reminder/
    - assets/icons/settings/
    - assets/icons/sos/
    - assets/images/
    - .env.dev
    - .env.prod

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Manrope
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/manrope/Manrope-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/manrope/Manrope-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
          
    - family: Colfax
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/colfax/Colfax-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/colfax/Colfax-Bold.otf
          weight: 700

    - family: Visby Round CF
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/visby_round/VisbyRoundCF-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/visby_round/VisbyRoundCF-Bold.otf
          weight: 700

    - family: Krona One
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/krona_one/KronaOne-Regular.ttf
